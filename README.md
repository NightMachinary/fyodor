# Fyodor

Convert your Amazon Kindle highlights, notes and bookmarks into markdown files.


## What is it about
This application parses `My Clippings.txt` from your Kindle and generates a markdown file for each book/document, in the format `#{Author} - #{Title}.md`. This way, your annotations on the books you read are conveniently stored and easily managed.

Unlike other similar applications, this tries to be locale agnostic, so it should work no matter language you are using.

The parsing is based on the clippings generated by Kindle 2019, but should work with other models.


## Installation

The only dependencies are Ruby and the TOML gem:

```
$ gem install toml
```

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/rccavalcanti/fyodor.git
```


## Configuration

If your Kindle is not in English, you should inform some strings from your clippings file. That is how _highlight_, _note_, _page_, etc. are called there. You do this in the config file, in `parser` section.

You can also ask the program to ignore some books, setting them in `ignored_books` section.

To use any of those features, copy the sample config and edit it. It can be placed on the root of the application directory as `config.toml` or at `~/.config/fyodor.toml`.

```
$ cd fyodor
$ cp config.toml{.sample,}  # or cp config.toml.sample ~/.config/fyodor.toml
## edit it
```


## Running

```
$ cd fyodor
$ ./fyodor CLIPPINGS_FILE OUTPUT_DIR
```

Or if you linked it to a directory in your PATH:
```
$ fyodor CLIPPINGS_FILE OUTPUT_DIR
```

Where:
* `CLIPPINGS_FILE` is the path for `My Clippings.txt`
* `OUTPUT_DIR` is the path to the directory for the markdown files to be written
